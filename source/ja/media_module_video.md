# Video 

Add Video files to play on your Layouts and Playlists from the [Library Search](layouts_editor.html#content-toolbar). 

{feat}Video|v4{/feat}

## Overview

- [Upload](media_library.html#content-add-media-upload) new video files directly to Playlists/Layouts from the [Library Search](layouts_editor.html#content-library-search).
- Files uploaded directly to Playlists and Layouts are automatically saved to the [Library](media_library.html) for re-use.
- Video files can also be uploaded in advance to the Library.

{tip}
We recommend H264 MP4 file format.

When uploading video files the scroll bar can be used to select a frame to be used as a thumbnail in the CMS for easier identification.

{/tip}

- Set [start and end times](media_playlists.html#content-widget-expiry-dates) for video files uploaded directly to a Playlist.

- Save video files to [Folders](tour_folders.html#content-saving-to-folders) on upload, to easily control access to Users.

- Uploaded video files are cached for off-line playback.

- Control the duration of the video file.
  - Set a lower duration to cut the original file short.

  - Set a higher duration and use the Loop function to "loop" back to the beginning to satisfy a longer duration.

- Aspect and Stretch scaling options.

- Expand the top of existing content to show the video full screen.

- Mute videos that have audio.

- Select videos to use from Pixabay without leaving the CMS.
