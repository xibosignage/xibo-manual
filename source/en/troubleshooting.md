# Troubleshooting

Need help? Please ask for help or advice in the [[[PRODUCTNAME]]
Community]([[PRODUCTSUPPORTURL]]).

It is likely that the support representative will ask you to visit the Fault
page in the CMS so that some logging can be generated for your issue.

When asking for assistance it is essential that as much information as possible
is included. A minimum of the version of the software you are using and the
steps to recreate the problem you are having.

General questions are also welcome!

## Reporting a Fault

The CMS has a central "error log" which collects messages from all components in
the platform - CMS, Players, API,  Maintenance, etc. Providing relevant
information from the log is often the key to a support representative finding
the solution to any problems.

CMS logging can be provided from the Fault page accessible from the
Administration menu. A fault wizard will be shown taking you through the steps
to collect and download a `troubleshoot.zip` file which can be attached to
your support request.

## Raw Logs

Raw logs can be viewed in the CMS on the Advanced -> Log page. If you want to
understand the contents of these logs please  see [understanding the
log](advanced_logging.html).
