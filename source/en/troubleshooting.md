## CMS error log

The CMS collects messages from all the components within the platform; CMS, Players, API, Maintenance etc and so is a valuable resource when investigating issues.

CMS logging can be provided from the **Report Fault** page located under the Advanced section of the Menu. Click on start to be taken through the fault wizard which will guide you through the steps to collect and download a troubleshoot.zip file.
