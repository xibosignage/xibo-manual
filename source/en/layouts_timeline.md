# Layout Timeline

Each Region on a Layout has its own **Playlist** of content, which is shown in a specified order by the Player. 

A Playlist can consist of a **single item** (such as a company logo), or **multiple items** (such as an image slideshow).

{tip}
If you are using a version earlier than 2.3 for the v2 CMS, please use the following link: [v2 Layout Timeline](layouts_timeline_2.0.html). {/tip}

{tip}
If you are using 1.8 please use the following link: [Playlists](layouts_playlists.html).
{/tip}

A Region's Playlist is viewed/edited in the **Layout Timeline** window.

The timeline clearly shows how each Regions assigned Widgets will play. The greyed out entries indicate what will play when that items own duration is exceeded.

{tip}
The above Timeline tells us the following:

**Text** determines the duration of the Layout, as the longest running Region with a 60 second duration.

**Clock** has a set duration of 10 seconds but will remain on screen for 60 seconds (until the Text Widget has fully played out)

**Image 1** will play for 10 seconds then **Image 2** will play for 10 seconds, this will repeat twice more to remain on screen for 60 seconds (until the Text Widget has fully played out)
{/tip}

The window to the left of the Region gives a preview of the Region positioning on the Layout.

Click on the Region here to open the Region Editor and Region Options form to make edits.

## Assigning Content

Use the toolbar on the Layout Designer to add [Widgets](layouts_widgets.html) or use the [Library Search](layouts_library_search.html) to add content that has already been uploaded to the Library.

{tip}
Widgets that are available can be enabled/disabled by an Administrator in the Modules section of the CMS.
{/tip}

Once Media has been added, the timeline will automatically scroll to the newly added content (highlighted as green) for easy configuration.

Use the timeline buttons to zoom in and out to decrease / increase the visible time span and use the blue scroll bar to see all assigned content in your Timeline.
