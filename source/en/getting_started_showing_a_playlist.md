# Showing a Playlist on Displays

**Create** a **Playlist** of content and **Schedule** to show on **Displays**.

You may have a set of content collated to meet a specific requirement which need to be shown in a rotating sequence on Displays. Playlists allow users to streamline resources and organise multiple content types to play in the order they need to be displayed.

Playlists can have content added by automatic assignment based on selected criteria or by manual selection. For this example Image content already uploaded to the CMS Media Library will be added to a Playlist manually.
