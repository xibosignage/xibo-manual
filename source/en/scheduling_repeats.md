# Repeat scheduling

Set up recurring Events to repeat at specified intervals. **Repeating Events** is an efficient way to create the same Event details, to be shown multiple times without the need to manually duplicate information over and over. It could be useful for content that needs to shown regularly on Displays such as recurring room bookings and meeting events and reduces the need to manually keep schedules updated.

## How-to create repeats

Once an Event has been created with start and end times, an appropriate repeat (Minute, Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly or Yearly) can be configured from the **Repeats** tab under **Optional**.


For example selecting a **Weekly Repeat** you could select Wednesday and Friday as the days of the week to Repeat the Event, and by entering a 2, it would Repeat Every other week on those days.

**Monthly Repeats** can be configured by the Event date or by which day in the month the Event falls on. An Event which is scheduled on Thursday 19/06 can be set to Repeat every month on the 3rd Thursday for example.

Use **Until** to control when the repeated event should finish.

Ensure the time selected here is after the final repetition of the defined Event so as to not cut the play back of content short!

**Recurring Events** can be removed from the Schedule in their entirety using the Grid view and selecting Delete from the row menu. All instances of the recurring event will be removed. 

Alternatively, remove only an instance of a recurring event:

- Use the **Calendar** view to locate the Recurring Event by date. 
- Click on the event to open the schedule form. The event instance details will be clearly shown at the bottom of the form.

- Click **Delete from Schedule** to remove only this instance from scheduling. All other instances will remain scheduled.

**NOTE:** Care should be taken if amendments are made to a recurring Schedule after deleting an individual Event instance. Previously deleted Event instances could be recreated when making edits to an existing recurring Schedule!
