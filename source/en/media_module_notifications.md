# Notifications

Display Notifications on Layouts and Playlists as well as target messaging to Display/Display Groups using the Notification Widget.

Users can create messages by clicking **Notification Centre** which is accessed by clicking the alarm bell icon next to the User Profile.

{tip}
Layouts need to already be in the schedule and contain the Notification Widget to target Display/Display Groups successfully!

## Notification Elements

Elements are available for selection when adding the Notification Widget to a [Layout](layouts_editor.html) to give Users more control over what components of Notifications to use and where they can be placed.

Each Element has a set of configuration options in the Properties Panel. Control how items should be cycled by specifying a [Data Slot](layouts_editor.html#content-data-slots) to use for each of the added Elements. Data Elements can be further complimented by adding Global Elements to add shapes and text which can all be put into an Element Group for easier configuration and positioning.
