# Showing a Video on Displays

Add a **Video** file to your **Media Library** and **Schedule** to play on **Displays**.

You may have Video content which has been created to showcase product promotions or show company updates to employees, ready to be shown full screen on your Display network.

Video files are first added to the Library by upload or by URL. For this example a Video file will be uploaded to the CMS Media Library.

**Duration in loop** determines how long the video should play each time it appears in a **Schedule Loop**. 

- Set a lower duration to cut the original file short or set a higher duration and the video will "loop" back to the beginning to satisfy a longer set duration.
- Select a a specific **Resolution** to use.
- Set a **colour** to fill any gaps in the background if the media file will not fill the screen.
- **Save** to close the **Select Media** form and continue with scheduling.

### Schedule Event

 Complete the fields in the **Schedule Event** form:

- Give the event a **Name** for easier identification in the CMS.
- Select which **Displays** this Video will be shown on.
- From **Dayparting**, select **Always** to show the Video constantly or select **Custom** to set specific start and end dates/times.
- Click **Save.**


The CMS will now update a Schedule change and your Video will be shown on Displays for the timings set in the schedule.

## FAQ's

***What are Schedule Loops?*** 

A Schedule Loop is how media content will play when in schedules with other media content. For example, if you have scheduled 2 media items each with a 10 second duration to be shown at the same time for 1 hour, both items will play for their 10 second durations in fair rotation for the scheduled time.

***Which file format is recommended for Videos?***

We recommend H264 MP4 file format.
