# Showing an Image on Displays

Add an **Image** file to your **Media Library** and **Schedule** to play on **Displays**.

You may have image content created outside of the Layout Editor, e.g. created by an agency, in house marketing team etc, ready to be shown full screen on your Display network.

Image files are first added to the Library by upload or by URL. For this example an Image file will be uploaded to the CMS Media Library.
