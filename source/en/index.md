#[[PRODUCTNAME]] Documentation

Welcome to the user manual for [[PRODUCTNAME]] - this documentation applies to [[PRODUCTNAME]] Version [[PRODUCTVERSION]]. We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for using [[PRODUCTNAME]].

[[PRODUCTNAME]] is a powerful Digital Signage content management system and suite of signage players. According to Wikipedia, Digital Signage is:

> Digital signage is a form of electronic display that shows information, advertising and other messages. Digital signs (such as LCD, LED, plasma displays, or projected images) can be found in public and private environments, such as retail stores and corporate buildings

> *Various authors from Wikipedia*



[[PRODUCTNAME]] is a digital signage solution and is a suite of applications, including a:

* Content Management System (CMS)
* Windows Signage Player
* Push Messaging - Xibo Message Relay (XMR - bundled with the CMS)
* Android Signage Player *
* webOS Signage Player *



With [[PRODUCTNAME]] your content is designed from anywhere using a web browser on the internet accessible CMS, scheduled to your Players, which we call Displays, and then downloaded automatically when appropriate. This manual will guide you through the application from installation to troubleshooting, from the CMS to the Displays.

### Open Source

The heart of the software is open source and has been for many years! We're committed to keeping it that way and everything you need to run your digital signage network with [[PRODUCTNAME]] is Open Source and will always be Open Source.

Open Source is great, but it can sometimes be a little daunting to tackle a new piece of software all alone. The project offers some commercial products and services designed to help you on your journey, all of which are completely optional.

By choosing any of our commercial services, you are enabling the ongoing development and maintenance of the project by enabling us to employ great developers, support staff and infrastructure.

##Closing thoughts
**Think about your target audience...**

Digital signs are there to service a need for information. People will only look at a digital sign if there is some information being shown that they need, or are interested in. It's important then to ensure a good mix of information and targeted advertising (if desired) to meet the business's goals. For example, combine a list of upcoming events with a list of sports results, a news feed or bus times to draw attention.

[[PRODUCTNAME]] can schedule different items to be shown at different times of the day. Be sure to target content to the times when your target audience are in the building (eg advertise events for young children when parents are arriving to drop of or collect children for an existing event).

People need to be able to read what is on the sign. Be sure to take a look at your completed work and make sure it's possible to read it in the time that it appears on the screen, and that the font size is large enough etc.
