Uploaded video files are cached for off-line playback which can then be added to Layouts.

Video files can be uploaded to the [Library](media_library.html) or uploaded directly to Layouts using the Video [Library Search](layouts_library_search.html) function from the Toolbar in the Layout Designer.

## Configuration Options

Once added to a Layout, click on the **Video** file icon in the **Timeline** or **Viewer** to open configuration options in the right hand properties panel:

- Provide an optional **Name** if required.

Here you can see how long the video will play for. 

- Tick the **Set a duration** to provide a specific duration for the Video file.

With **Set a duration** ticked you can set a lower duration to cut the file short or select a higher duration and use the Loop function!

### Configuration

- Use the **Configuration** tab to select the **Scale type** for the video.

**Please note:** Scaling is currently supported by Android, webOS and Tizen Players (from v2 R200) and Windows Players (from v2 R253).

- If the video has audio this can be muted by ticking the box.
- If you tick to **Show Full Screen**, the video will show full screen whilst it is playing. When the next item in the Timeline is shown it will revert back to the size of the Region.

Use the **Context Menu** at the bottom of the viewer to apply further options to the Video Widget.
