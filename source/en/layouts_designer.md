# Layout Designer

The Layout Designer is the heart of **content creation** in [[PRODUCTNAME]]. Each time a new Layout is added, or an existing one needs a design change, the Layout Designer is used.

{tip}
If you are using the **1.8** series CMS, please use the following link: [Layout Designer 1.8](layouts_designer_1.8.html)
{/tip}

[[PRODUCTNAME]] makes layout design simple through the use of **drag and drop**,**interactive previewing** and **design flexibility**. On adding a new Layout, the Layout Designer will open.

## Layout Navigator

This is located in the bottom corner of the Layout Designer window. As shown in the above image, all new Layouts, by default, have one full screen empty [Region](layouts_regions.html), represented as a semi-transparent overlay.  The Layout Navigator is used to add, position and resize Regions and gives an overview to the overall layout design.

Clicking on a **Region** in the opened Layout Navigator window, opens the **Region Options** form which allows for refinement of  **Positioning** and the application of **Transitions**.

## Layout Timeline

Located next to the Layout Navigator the Layout Timeline displays the duration of individual Widgets as well as complete layout duration which is based on the longest running region on the layout.

A status indicator is shown (cross or tick) to identify valid and invalid Layouts.  **Invalid layouts will be excluded from the Schedule and will not be played.**

{tip}
A Layout must contain at least one Region **and** each Region must contain at least **one** media item for it to be valid and play when scheduled.
