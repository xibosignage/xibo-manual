- Set [start and end times](media_playlists.html#content-widget-expiry-dates) for audio files uploaded directly to a Playlist.
- Save  audio files to [Folders](tour_folders.html#content-saving-to-folders) on upload, to easily control access to Users.
- Uploaded audio files are cached for off-line playback.
- Fully compatible with [Overlay Layouts.](layouts_overlay.html)
- Control the duration of the audio file.
  - Set a lower duration to cut the original file short.

  - Set a higher duration and use the Loop function to "loop" back to the beginning to satisfy a longer duration.
- Attach Audio files to other Widgets.

Audio can also be attached to other Widgets using the [Context Menu](layouts_editor.html#content-context-menu)

{tip}
When attaching to Widgets, Users can enter a Volume as well as a Loop parameter to determine whether the audio will loop for the duration of the attached Widget or just play through once. Audio will stop once the parent Widget finishes playing!
