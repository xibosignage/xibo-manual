## Audio

Audio files are uploaded to the library and served to the player for
off line playback.

They can be used on a region time line as a normal widget - i.e. assigned to
the region play list - or they can be assigned to play at the start of another
media item.

Each media item in a play list has an audio icon to indicate whether an audio
widget has been assigned to it. The icon is gray if the widget doesn't have
any assignments.
