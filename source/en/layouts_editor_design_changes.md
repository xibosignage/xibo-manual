# Layout Design Changes

From time to time, **Layouts** may need design changes/updates to keep content fresh and relevant. [[PRODUCTNAME]] will continue to show the Published Layout design already in Display Schedules allowing Users to make important changes to a checked out draft version of the Layout. Only approved changes will overwrite the existing design once a User selects to Publish.

Layouts that are in a **Draft** status are simply edited by using the row menu and selecting **Design** to open the Layout Editor.

Selecting **Design** for a **Published Layout** will show that it is locked for editing. 

- Click **View** to see all the components of the Layout in a read only mode.
- Click **Checkout** to create a draft of the Layout to enable editing.

Once a Layout has been "checked out", a copy of the Layout is made in a draft status. This draft Layout will not reflect any changes to the published version. Any **Display** schedules will continue to show the **Published** version of this **Layout** allowing Users to take their time with any design changes that need to be made.

Layouts can also be "checked out" from the row menu ahead of a User needing to make design changes. Select the 'auto submit' checkbox to send the form automatically without the additional approval window every time Checkout is selected!

## Layout Lock

To prevent multiple Users making edits to the same Layout concurrently, the Layout will lock.

The Layout will remain locked to other Users for the time specified in the lock message. The Layout can be unlocked by the current User by using the Options menu and selecting **Unlock**. Once unlocked, the current user will be redirected back to the Layouts grid.

To revert the Layout back to it's original published state, use the **Options** menu and select **Discard Draft**. 

## Publish options

To make the changes permanent and overwrite the existing Published Layout, select **Publish**. 

Layouts can be published straight away using the **Publish Now** checkbox, or unticking this options provides the User to set a date and time as a **Publish Date**.

{tip}
Setting a **Publish Date i**s not an alternative to creating an event in a schedule!

Once published the CMS will update a Layout change so that the approved design changes will be shown on Displays.
