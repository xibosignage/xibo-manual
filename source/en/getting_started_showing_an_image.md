# Showing an Image on Displays

Add an **Image** file to your **Media Library** and **Schedule** to play on **Displays**.

You may have image content created outside of the Layout Editor, e.g. created by an agency, in house marketing team etc, ready to be shown full screen on your Display network.

Image files are first added to the Library by upload or by URL. For this example an Image file will be uploaded to the CMS Media Library.

- Select which **Displays** to show the Image on. 
- If you want to use the default **Always** schedule, and happy with the default settings and have no further advanced scheduling options to set, you can click **Finish** to complete the schedule.
- If you want to select alternative created **Dayparts** or **Custom** dates, select **Next**.
- If you don't need to apply any further scheduling options and are happy with the defaults set for **Duration in Loop**, **Resolution** etc, click to **Finish**.

**Duration in loop** determines how long this Image should be shown each time it appears in a **Schedule Loop**.

The CMS will now update a Schedule change and the Image will be shown on Displays for the timings set in the schedule.
