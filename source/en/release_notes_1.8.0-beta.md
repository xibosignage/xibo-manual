# [[PRODUCTNAME]] 1.8.0-beta - Codename "Tempel"</span>

Welcome to the release notes for the third alpha release in the 1.8 Series of
[[PRODUCTNAME]], codenamed "Tempel".

 **This should NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION.**.

This release contains significant changes from 1.7 Series and significant
changes from the 1.8.0-alpha releases and these release notes should be read an
understood before trying the release.

You can download this release from
[GitHub](https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo-cms/releases/tag/1.8.0-beta).

## Requirements

[[PRODUCTNAME]] requires PHP 5.5 or higher. Please read the details in [install
environment](install_environment.html) to understand the extra configuration 1.8
Series requires before proceeding.

We recommend using the 1.8.0-beta Windows Player with this release. The 1.7.6 or
later version of the Windows Display Player is also compatible with this CMS,
but will not run the latest features.

### XMR (message relay)

1.8 series supports *push* messaging via a new service called XMR. XMR is built
on top of `ZermoMQ` and therefore `ZermoMQ` is requirement for use.

The CMS will function without `ZeroMQ` or `XMR` installed, however it is
advisable to use it as it improves the overall performance of the CMS and
Players. Further instructions can be found on the [XMR](xmr.html) manual page.

### Special Considerations
#### Windows Player

The 1.7 series contained experimental support for CEF browser integration. This
has been removed in the 1.8 release due to stability issues. In 1.8 you will
not be able to use CEF as an alternative rendering engine.

We are working towards a new cross platform player which will replace this
Windows player and will also support Ubuntu. This development can be tracked
on our [community](https://community.xibo.org.uk/t/cross-platform-player-specification/6261)
forum. One aim is for the player to support multiple browser rendering engines
when running on Windows.
