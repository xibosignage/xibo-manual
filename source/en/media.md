# Media 

[[PRODUCTNAME]] supports a wide variety of Media which can be categorised into 2 different types:

1. **Library Media**
2. **Layout Media**

## Library Media

Library Media is file-based Media that is uploaded and stored in the CMS Library for use on one or multiple Layouts.

{tip}
From v3.1.0 integration with Pixaby allows for Images and Videos to be selected when adding content to Layouts using [Library Searches](layouts_library_search.html). Selections will be automatically added to the Library!

Examples of Library Media are:

- Images
- Videos
- Fonts

Library Media is administered from **Media** under the Library section of the Menu. 

{tip}
[DataSets](media_datasets.html) and [Menu Boards](layouts_menuboards.html) are a special type of Library Media which are used to represent tabular data.

## Layout Media

Layout Media is created and stored directly on a Layout. This Media cannot be reused and exists on only 1 Playlist specific to a particular Layout.

Examples of Layout Media are:

- Text
- Ticker
- Embedded Content
