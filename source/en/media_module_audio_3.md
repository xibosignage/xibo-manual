{/tip}

Audio files can also be directly uploaded to a specified **Folder** location.

{/tip}

- Click in the Folder you wish to upload the file to and click **Done**. 
- The **Current Folder** will now show the selected file path.


Further information regarding Folder access and set-up can be found [here](https://xibosignage.com/manual/en/tour_folders)

There is an option to set expiry dates and times for files uploaded to this particular Widget.

{tip}
This is particularly useful should you need to preload audio for a later date/time!
{/tip}

- Tick the **Set Expiry Dates** box.

![Expiry Dates](img/v3_media_audio_expiry_dates.png)

- Use the date picker to select **Start** and **End** dates and times.

- Further options are available to remove the Widget from the Playlist on expiry and to delete the media file from the Library.


- Click the **Start upload** button to begin the upload of all files added. If a Folder/Expiry Dates have been selected and there are multiple files to be added, all files will be uploaded to the specified location and have the same Expiry Dates set.
- Once successfully uploaded, click **Done**.

Files can also be uploaded individually and have different Folder locations/Expiry dates and times specified.
Instead of clicking on the Start upload button, click on the **blue upload** button shown at the end of the row for an added file. 

Change the Folder location using the **Select Folder** button as before and then click the blue button at the end of the row to upload just that singular file.

![Multiple Files](img/v3_media_audio_multiple_files.png)

- Once all files have been individually uploaded, click **Done**.

## Configuration Options

Click on the added **Audio Widget** from the **Timeline** to open configuration options in the **Edit Audio** form:

![Edit Options](img/v3_media_audio_edit_options.png)

- Make edits to naming of the Widget if required
- Here you can see how long the audio will play for. Tick the **Set a duration** to provide a specific duration.

{tip}
Set a lower duration than shown to cut the audio short or select a higher duration and use the Loop function!

The Audio Widget is fully compatible with [Overlay Layouts](layouts_overlay.html) and can therefore be used effectively to draw attention and compliment content.
