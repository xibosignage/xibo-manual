# Simple Scheduling

[[PRODUCTNAME]] has a variety of scheduling tools in order to deliver the right content at the right location at the right time.

All content to be shown on authorised Displays must be included in a Schedule. Displays check for new scheduled content periodically and will download any new items in advance of playback ready to be shown.

You may have a Layout created by a member of your team, in order to share an important announcement within a company, which is now Published and ready to be shown on Displays.

## Creating a Schedule

- Click on **Schedule** from the main CMS menu.
- Click the **Add Event** button.

Complete the fields in the **Schedule Event** form:

- Give the event a **Name** for easier identification in the CMS.
- Use the **Event Type** drop down to select the type of Event to Schedule. For this example, select **Layout**.
- Select which **Displays** to show the Layout on. 
- From **Dayparting**, choose **Always** to show the Layout on Displays constantly or select **Custom** to set specific start and end dates/times.
- Select the **Use Relative time** option if the Layout should be shown immediately and provide how long it should remain showing on Displays by providing hours and minutes.
- Use the drop down to select the **Layout** to show.
- Click **Save.**

The CMS will now update a Schedule change and show the Layout on Displays for the specified time.

The Scheduled Event can be viewed/edited from the Schedule grid and Calendar views.
