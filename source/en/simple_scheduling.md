# Simple Scheduling

[[PRODUCTNAME]] has a variety of scheduling tools in order to deliver the right content at the right location at the right time.

All content to be shown on authorised Displays must be included in a Schedule. Displays check for new scheduled content periodically and will download any new items in advance of playback ready to be shown.

You may have a Layout created by a member of your team, in order to share an important announcement within a company, which is now Published and ready to be shown on Displays.

## Creating a Schedule

- Click on **Schedule** from the main CMS menu.
- Click the **Add Event** button.

Follow the steps in the schedule wizard:

- Use the **Event Type** drop down to select the type of Event to Schedule. For this example, select **Layout**.
- Use the drop down to select the **Layout** to show, click **Next**.
- Select which **Displays** to show the Layout on. 
- If you want to use the default **Always** schedule, can click **Finish** to complete.
- If you want to select alternative created **Dayparts** or **Custom** dates, select **Next**.
- With **Custom** selected, use the Relative time option to show the Layout straight away. Provide how long it should remain showing on displays by entering the hours and minutes.
- Click to **Finish** or **Next** to access further scheduling options such as **Priority, Display Order** and **Repeats**.

The CMS will now update a Schedule change and show the Layout on Displays for the specified time.

The Scheduled Event can be viewed/edited from the **Schedule Grid** and **Calendar** views.
