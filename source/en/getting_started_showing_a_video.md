# Showing a Video on Displays

Add a **Video** file to your **Media Library** and **Schedule** to play on **Displays**.

You may have Video content which has been created to showcase product promotions or show company updates to employees, ready to be shown full screen on your Display network.

Video files are first added to the Library by upload or by URL. For this example a Video file will be uploaded to the CMS Media Library.

### Add Media

- Click on **Media** under the **Library** section of the main CMS menu.
- Click the **Add Media** button.
- Select **Add files** and select the Video file to upload.
- Use the scroll bar to select a frame to use as the Video thumbnail, to make it easier to identify in Media Library lists.
- Provide a new **Name** or leave this field blank to keep the original file name.
- Click **Start upload**.

- Once uploaded click **Done**.

### Select Media

- From the **Media** grid use the filters to make it easier to find the uploaded video file if required.
- Use the row menu and select **Schedule**.
- Select which **Displays** to show the video on. 

- If you want to use the default **Always** schedule, and happy with the default settings and have no further scheduling options to set, you can click **Finish** to complete the schedule.
- If you want to select alternative created **Dayparts** or **Custom** dates, select **Next**.
- To configure advanced scheduling options and override the duration of the video for example, click **Next**.
- **Duration in loop** determines how long this video should be shown each time it appears in a **Schedule Loop**. 
- You can specify a **duration** here and provide a lower duration to cut the video short. When setting a higher duration, the video will loop back to the beginning and play to satisfy the duration applied.
- Click to **Finish** once all relevant fields have been completed.


The CMS will now update a Schedule change and your Video will be shown on Displays for the timings set in the schedule.

## FAQs

***I don't see the wizard when scheduling a Video?***

A wizard was introduced in v4.4 to simplify the scheduling process. Use the link to view the earlier flow: [Showing a Video](getting_started_showing_a_video_v4.html)

***What are Schedule Loops?*** 

A Schedule Loop is how media content will play when in schedules with other media content. For example, if you have scheduled 2 media items each with a 10 second duration to be shown at the same time for 1 hour, both items will play for their 10 second durations in fair rotation for the scheduled time.

***Which file format is recommended for Videos?***

We recommend H264 MP4 file format.
